Module: test_step

This module defines the `TestStep` class, which represents a single step in a test execution sequence.
Each test step has a name and an associated action (a callable function) that is executed when the step is run.

The `TestStep` class is designed to be used within the broader context of a test definition, where multiple
test steps are executed in sequence to complete a full test.

Classes:
    TestStep: A class representing a single step in a test, which includes a name and an action to execute.

    Represents a single step in a test execution sequence.

    A test step consists of a name and an associated action, which is a callable function that is executed
    when the step is run. Test steps are typically used in a sequence to build up the logic for a complete test.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the test step.
        action (Callable): The action (a callable function) to be executed for this test step.

    Methods:
        run(context): Executes the action associated with the test step, providing the context to the action.
